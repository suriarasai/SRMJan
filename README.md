# SRMJan22

This workshop will provide a snapshot of essential data engineering practices today. To the fullest extent, the workshop will focus mainly on two aspects. (1) Firstly, the essential “immutable’ s” of data engineering - what hasn’t changed, and what won’t likely change in the future. (2) Secondly a generic framework to guide you on your data engineering journey for many years to come.
By attending this workshop, participants will be able to:
•	Understand the growth of data and need for a scalable data engineering practices and a guided processing framework. 
•	Understand the various types of Data Driven Computational Architecture and their relevant strengths / short comings
•	Understand modern data intensive project life cycle activities.
•	Gain hands on practical experience for various data pipeline processing and functional computations using open source Apache Spark Framework along with relevant flow architectures.
